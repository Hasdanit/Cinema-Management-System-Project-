# **Overview**

The Cinema Manage ment System Project is a Java-based application designed to manage various operations of a cinema, including movie creation, ticket booking, user interface generation, and movie scheduling. The system utilizes five creational design patterns: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.

## **Features**

  **Movie Creation:** Create different types of movies (Regular, IMAX, 3D) using the Factory Method pattern.
  
  **Ticket Booking:** Book tickets with options for seat selection, snack combos, and special screenings using the Builder pattern.
  
  **User Interface Generation:** Generate different themes (Dark, Light) for the cinema's booking system using the Abstract Factory pattern.
  
  **Movie Scheduling:** Clone and modify movie schedules using the Prototype pattern.
  
  **System Configuration:** Manage global settings such as cinema name, number of screens, and operating hours using the Singleton pattern.
  
## **Design Patterns Used**
  **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures only one instance of the CinemaConfig class exists throughout the application.
  
  **Factory Method Pattern:** Allows for the creation of different types of movies based on user or system input.
  
  **Abstract Factory Pattern:** Creates user interface elements for different themes consistently.
  
  **Builder Pattern:** Constructs complex ticket bookings step-by-step.
  
  **Prototype Pattern:** Clones and modifies movie schedules easily.
